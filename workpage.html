        Historical Context
      </h3>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-left">
        The Women of Malolos refers to a group of 20 women from prominent Chinese-Filipino families in Malolos, Bulacan, who made a significant impact in Philippine history. On December 12, 1888, these women, led by the Tanchanco, Reyes, Santos, Tantoco, and Tiongson families, petitioned Governor-General Valeriano Weyler for permission to open a night school where they could learn Spanish. This was a bold move, as education for women was not widely supported during the Spanish colonial period. <br> <br> The Spanish parish priest, Fr. Felipe Garcia, opposed their request, leading to its initial denial. However, the women persisted, demonstrating remarkable courage and determination. Their efforts eventually paid off when they received approval to open the school, with the condition that classes be held during the day and that Señorita Guadalupe Reyes would be their teacher. <br> <br> This event caused a significant stir in both the Philippines and Spain, highlighting the growing desire for education and reform among Filipinos. Dr. José Rizal, who was in London at the time, was inspired by their bravery. At the request of Marcelo H. del Pilar, Rizal wrote a letter to the women on February 22, 1889, praising their efforts and encouraging them to continue their pursuit of education and empowerment
